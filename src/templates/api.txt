# hilite.me API documentation

GET or POST to http://www.hilite.me/api with these parameters:

* code: source code to format
* lexer: [lexer](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/) to use, default it 'python'
* style: [style](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/) to use, default is 'colorful'
* linenos: if not empty, the HTML will include line numbers
* divstyles: CSS style to use in the wrapping <div> element, can be empty

The request will return the HTML code in UTF-8 encoding.

Feel free to use the API as you see fit, but please let me know if you expect to have a lot of requests, I will need to bump the App Engine quotas.
