Installing hilite.me
====================

If you want to install hilite.me as your own App Engine application you need to do the following:

*   Download the latest [Pygments tarball][1] and copy the contents of the `pygments` directory into `./src/pygments`.
*   Open `./update` and set `--email` to your email address.
*   Open `./src/app.yaml` and change the application from `hilite-me` to your own.
*   Open `./src/templates/index.html` and remove the Google Analytics tracking code at the bottom of the template, or replace with our own.

After this you can deploy the app using `./update`

Please note that under AGPLv3 license deploying hilite.me requires that you share its source code with all modifications you have made. See COPYING for details.
